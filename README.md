# FSJ01 - Challenge 1

## Project Brief

In this project, we set out to transform a basic e-commerce store built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS into a feature-rich and user-friendly online shopping destination. The challenge was to identify and address any existing issues, while also extending the functionality to provide a truly seamless and engaging shopping experience for our users.

## Overview

### Unlocking the Power of Vue.js

At the core of our e-commerce store lies the powerful Vue.js framework, which allowed us to build a modern and responsive user interface. By leveraging Vue Router for navigation and Vuex for state management, we were able to create a smooth and efficient shopping experience, with dynamic content and seamless transitions between pages.

### Enhancing the User Journey

One of our primary goals was to improve the overall user journey, and we achieved this by introducing several key features:

1. **Secure Login:** We implemented a functional and responsive login page, integrating JWT Decode for an authentication system that ensures the security and privacy of user data.
2. **Comprehensive Shopping Cart:** Customers can now easily add products to their shopping cart, view the cart's contents, and manage their purchases with complete control.
3. **Intelligent Comparison List:** Users can conveniently compare products, side-by-side, to make informed purchasing decisions.
4. **Personalized Wishlist:** The addition of a wishlist feature allows customers to save their favorite products for future consideration.
5. **Ratings and Reviews:** Shoppers can now share their experiences by leaving ratings and reviews for the products they've purchased, fostering a sense of community and trust.
